# Exercise 1: List and Indexing
#
# Create a list named students containing at least three student names (strings).
# Assign the second student’s name to a variable named first_student.
# Assign the last student’s name to a variable named last_student.

def manage_students():
    # your code here
    students=["zainab","sara","fatima"]
    first_student=students[1]
    last_student=students[-1]
    return first_student, last_student



# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 1:', manage_students())



# Exercise 2: Loop and String Concatenation
#
# Create a tuple named foods containing the same number of foods (strings) as there are names in the students list.
# Create a variable named meal and assign an empty string to it.
# Use a for loop to iterate over the strings in foods and append each string to meal.

def combine_foods():
    # your code here
    foods=("pizza","burger","sushi")
    meal=""

    for food in foods:
       meal += food

    return meal

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 2:', combine_foods())
