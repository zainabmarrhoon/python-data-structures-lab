# Exercise 1: List and Indexing
#
# Create a list named students containing at least three student names (strings).
# Assign the second student’s name to a variable named first_student.
# Assign the last student’s name to a variable named last_student.

def manage_students():
    # your code here
    students=["zainab","sara","fatima"]
    first_student=students[1]
    last_student=students[-1]
    return first_student, last_student



# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 1:', manage_students())



# Exercise 2: Loop and String Concatenation
#
# Create a tuple named foods containing the same number of foods (strings) as there are names in the students list.
# Create a variable named meal and assign an empty string to it.
# Use a for loop to iterate over the strings in foods and append each string to meal.

def combine_foods():
    # your code here
    foods=("pizza","burger","sushi")
    meal=""

    for food in foods:
       meal += food

    return meal

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 2:', combine_foods())



# Exercise 3: Slicing Tuples
#
# Using the slice operator, assign a new tuple containing only the last two food strings in the foods to a variable named last_two_foods.

def slice_foods():
    # your code here
    foods = ('Pizza', 'Burger', 'Pasta')
    last_two_foods = foods[-2:]
    return last_two_foods


# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 3:', slice_foods())




# Exercise 4: Dictionaries and String Formatting
#
# Create a dictionary named home_town containing the keys of city, state, and population.
# Using the home_town dictionary, assign to a variable named home_town_message a string with this format: “I was born in <city>, <state> - population of <population>”

def hometown_info():
    # your code here
       home_town = {
        'city': 'Manama',
        'state': 'Bahrain',
        'population': 200000
    }
       home_town_message = f"I was born in {home_town['city']}, {home_town['state']} - population of {home_town['population']}"

       return home_town_message






# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 4:', hometown_info())




# Exercise 5: Iterating Over Dictionary Items
#
# Define an empty list named home_town_items.
# Use a for loop to iterate over the key: value pairs in the home_town dictionary and append a string with the following format to home_town_items: "<key> = <value>"

def list_home_town_items():
    # your code here
    home_town = {
        'city': 'Manama',
        'state': 'Bahrain',
        'population': 200000
    }

    home_town_items = []

    for key, value in home_town.items():
        home_town_items.append(f"{key} = {value}")

    return home_town_items

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 5:', list_home_town_items())
